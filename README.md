# password-checker
A personal password checker program (Python)

In the event of a data breach, hackers often use brute-force dictionary attacks to log into user accounts by looping through the collection of compromised usernames and passwords (key:value pairs) until a successful hit is reached. This program enables you to privately check if any of your passwords have ever been hacked at the comfort of your terminal/command prompt. This approach is more secure as compared to keying in your password on https://haveibeenpwned.com
